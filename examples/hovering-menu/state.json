Myanmar was the top country for donating money, and second in time, while the US was the top country for helping a stranger and 5th for volunteers. \nIt's also important to note that most of these benefits come when a person chooses to volunteer and cares a lot about those people they are working with. Feeling exploited or being obliged to do the work detract from any benefits. I would add that the type of work does make a difference, and working with organisations dealing with people who have been through a lot of violence and hardship can be tough – especially when those organizations are struggling – for resource reasons usually – to meet the needs of those they are trying to help. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nNaturally, most of the health benefits are connected to the psychological benefits. There's also always the issue of cause or consequence – are people who are more mentally healthy more likely to volunteer in the first place? Hence, here I've focused on those studies that show a change over time. Thanks for using Wonder! Please let us know if we can help with anything else!    ",
